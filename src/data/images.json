I know I haven't drawn for like a year and a half but I had to muster all I can for this. Tbh, I messed up with what I was initially doing and was running out of time, so I still hope this rushed one will be good enough.\nPutting all that aside, thank you for being an amazing person and I'm glad to have met you through chilumi. Starting just as a moot, then a client, and now friends. I hope for our friendships, like many we have met through the community we love so much, continues to last for the unforseeable future.\nI hope you have a great birthday and always remember to stay well, healthy, and hydrated!\nWith love from the lazy, goofy, dorky panda-wolfy!"
